package integration_test

// This is a placeholder for tests of a framework dependent deployment app.
// These will require the dotnet runtime, but right now this buildpack has no requirements.
// TODO add these tests once buildpack conforms to RFC #0001
// The framework-dependent-deployment app in testdata can be used.
